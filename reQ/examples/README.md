# reQ Examples

#### Index

* [Advent of Code](#advent-of-code-aocq)
* [GitHub](#github-githubq)
* [JIRA](#jira-jiraq)

Within this directory are a number of examples of usage for the reQ library. 
Each example consists of a Q script, which can (often) function standalone or 
(always) as a library loaded within other Q scripts. There is also a `.cfg` 
file for each example containing various configuration details (e.g. 
authorisation token, session cookie etc.).

Also present is a script named `util.q` consisting of any small utilities used
throughout the examples (e.g. for loading config file etc.).

While each script can be used as a "library" for the given service, it may be
necessary to modify these slightly in order to ensure file paths are correct
etc. depending on the layout of your code.

Also note that there is minimal/no error checking & handling in these scripts in
order to maintain simplicity - this should be added as required when using any
of this code in your own scripts.

### Config files

The config files are simple key-value pairs like so:

```
key1=value1
key2=value2
```

It should be simple and straightforward to modify these as required.

## Advent of Code (`aoc.q`)

This script provides functions for accessing the [Advent of
Code](http://adventofcode.com/) website. Two functions are provided, one for the
retrieval of a private leaderboard, and another for the retrieval of the
challenge input for a given day.

In order to use the script standalone, a number of command line args can be
supplied:

* `board` - the ID of a private leaderboard to display [no default]
* `year` - year to get board/input for [default: this year]
* `day` - day to get input for [default: today]
* `o` - output directory [default: working dir]

If `-board` is supplied, the board will be downloaded & shown, otherwise, a
challenge input will be downloaded & saved (using defaults if no overwrites
provided)

The only config value required for this example is your session cookie (you
should be able to retrieve this value by logging in with your browser and
checking in browser settings, generally the cookie is valid for ~30 days)

## GitHub (`github.q`)

This script provides a very simple example of accessing the GitHub API. It 
contains a single function, for retrieving a basic summary of a GitHub repo.

In terms of config, the only value required here is an authorisation token for
the GitHub API, to be placed in `github.cfg`.

In standalone mode, it uses positional arguments to provide the repo
information, which can be either in the `user/repo` format or `user repo`. For
example:

```

```

The same function can be used by loading the script within a q session/script
and calling `.gh.repo[user;repo]` where `user` & `repo` are strings, and the
return is the dictionary.

The other function available is `.gh.createissue` to add an issue on a repo. For 
example:

```
q)\l examples/github.q
q).gh.createissue["user";"repo";"There's a big ol' bug";"We have a critical bug here, it's a big deal.\n\nNeeds fixed";`bug]
"https://github.com/user/repo/issues/1"
```

The args are (in order):

* `user` - the username of the owner of the repo
* `repo` - name of the repo
* `title` - title for the issue
* `body` - body for the issue
* `labels` - labels for the issue (can be list of syms or strings, or a single sym/string)

## JIRA (`jira.q`)

This script contains several functions for interacting with Atlassian JIRA REST
API - for more details of the API, see [the official docs](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/server/).

The provided functions give access to a list of the projects within a JIRA 
workspace and the ability to create an issue within a given project.

For config, the required values are `url` (the URL of your JIRA instance) and
`user` (the user:pass combination for logging into JIRA).

A few examples:

```

"http://localhost:8080/rest/api/2/issue/10020"
```

For `.jira.createissue`, the args are (in order):

* `project` - passed by "key", can be string or symbol
* `summary` - title for JIRA issue
* `description` - body for JIRA issue
* `issuetype` - Bug, Task etc. - can be string or symbol
* `assignee` - username of person being assigned
* `labels` - labels to add to the JIRA ticket
